      <p>Water survival. I’m in a canyon here, as I travel in it gets deeper and narrower. Isn’t a nice feeling but
        surviving isn’t nice. It’s necessary.</p>

      <p>If you are going to be on the hills every weekend in a walking club or mountain biking, I would highly
        recommend getting yourselves a life straw. Drink from any water source with the certainty of not getting sick.
        Knowing that its clean water.</p>

      <p>I am testing out my new anti-eye windage system. I.e. ski goggles from Aldi. They work like a charm. Keep your
        eye lubricated. On the hills, the best way to do they is to wear eye protection.</p>

      <p>Do what you have to do and don’t ever give up until you are either saved or dead. If you need to climb, climb
        till you make the top. You have it inside you. We all do.</p>

        yourself with your own juices.</p>
