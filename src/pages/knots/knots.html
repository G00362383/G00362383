      <p>You’ll want to practice alternative methods of fire starting prior to when they are needed.</p>
      <p>• Easy: Use a lighter or waterproof matches. Keep your matches dry in a waterproof container. </p>
      <p>• Medium: Use a magnesium fire starter. Shave magnesium filings off the stick, use the back of your knife to
        create a spark and ignite the filings.</p>
      <p>• Advanced: A battery can be used to create a spark to light tinder. Use your vehicle battery (removed from
        vehicle or boat) by attaching wires or steel wool to connect the positive and negative posts. This will induce a
        spark or ignite the wool. With smaller batteries, align two batteries together, positive to negative. Use
        strands of steel wool to connect the posts to create a spark and ignite wool. A 9-volt battery works great.</p>
