      <b>Staffs</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>A staff should be one of the first tools you obtain. For walking, it provides support and helps in ascending
        and descending steep slopes. It provides some weapon's capabilities if used properly, especially against snakes
        and dogs. It should be approximately the same height as you or at least eyebrow height. The staff should be no
        larger than you can effectively wield when tired and undernourished. It provides invaluable eye protection when
        you are moving through heavy brush and thorns in darkness.</p>

      <b>Club</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>A simple club is a staff or branch. It must be short enough for you to swing easily, but long enough and strong
        enough for you to damage whatever you hit. Its diameter should fit comfortably in your palm, but it should not
        be so thin as to allow the club to break easily upon impact. A straight-grained hardwood is best if you can find
        it.</p>

      <b>KNIVES</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>A knife has three basic functions. It can puncture, slash or chop, and cut. A knife is also an invaluable tool
        used to construct other survival items. You may find yourself without a knife or you may need another type knife
        or a spear. To improvise you can use stone, bone, wood, or metal to make a knife or spear blade.</p>

      <b>SPEAR BLADES</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>To make spears, use the same procedures to make the blade that you used to make a knife blade. Then select a
        shaft (a straight sapling) 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) long. The length should allow you to handle the spear
        easily and effectively. Attach the spear blade to the shaft using lashing. The preferred method is to split the
        handle, insert the blade, then wrap or lash it tightly. </p>
