      <b>Find clean water</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Finding clean, uncontaminated water is the holy grail of survival.</p>
      <p><b> • Rain:</b> Collect, store and drink.</p>
      <p><b>• Snow:</b> The energy it requires for your body to absorb the water from snow is high. Instead of eating
        the
        snow, melt it first. This can easily be done over a fire or with a camp stove. If those aren’t options, use the
        sun. Accelerate the process by chopping up ice and hanging it in a water bag in direct sunlight. If there’s no
        sun, use your body’s heat.</p>

      <p>Boiling water for a minute is the best and safest way to kill off any pathogens.</p>
      <p><b>• Digging for water:</b> Certain plants indicate water sources are nearby. Identify plants, such as
        cattails,
        cottonwood or willows, and dig a seep hole until you reach moisture. Wait for water to collect in the hole.</p>
      <p><b>• Think topographically:</b> Rock outcropping, or indentations are likely areas for water to accumulate.
        Remember,
        water found in puddles or streams should be boiled</p>

      <p><b>• Dew:</b> Dew collects on plants and grasses. Using a cloth or piece of clothing soak up the dew and then
        squeeze it into a container. This can be a very effective method of collecting water. </p>
      <p><b>• Plant Moisture Bag:</b> Just like humans, plants sweat. Tie a plastic bag around a leafy branch of a tree,
        and over time, water will collect.</p>
