      <p>Foremost among the many problems that can compromise your survival ability are medical problems resulting from
        unplanned events, such as a accidental injuries or extreme climates. Many evaders and survivors have reported 
        difficulty in treating injuries and illness due to lack of training and medical supplies.</p><br>
      <p>Survivors have related feelings of apathy and helplessness because they could not treat themselves in their
        environment. The ability to treat yourself increases your morale and aids in your survival and eventual return
        to friendly forces.</p><br>
      <p>One man with a fair amount of basic medical knowledge can make a difference in the lives of many. Without
        qualified medical personnel available, it is you who must know what to do to stay alive.</p><br>
