      <p>You’ll want to practice alternative methods of fire starting prior to when they are needed.</p>
      <p><b>• Easy:</b> Use a lighter or waterproof matches. Keep your matches dry in a waterproof container. </p>
      <p><b>• Medium:</b> Use a magnesium fire starter. Shave filings off the stick, use the back of your knife to
        create a spark and ignite the filings.</p>
      <p><b>• Advanced:</b> A battery can be used to create a spark to light tinder. Use your vehicle battery (removed
        from vehicle or boat) by attaching wires or steel wool to connect the positive and negative posts. This will
        induce a spark or ignite the wool. With smaller batteries, align two batteries together, positive to negative.
        Use strands of steel wool to connect the posts to create a spark and ignite wool. A 9-volt battery works great.

      <p><b>• Create a tinder bundle:</b> Gather pine needles, dry leaves or thistle down and dry grass for tinder. </p>
      <p><b>• Start small:</b> Gather small, dry sticks for kindling.</p>
      <p><b>• Go big:</b> Find larger pieces of wood for long-burning fuel.</p>
      <p><b>• Put it together:</b> Using a larger piece of wood as a wind block, create a nest out of the tinder. Create
        a tipi out of smaller kindling so oxygen can get in. Ignite the tinder and place under the tepee. Use long,
        steady breaths to spread the flame. As the smaller pieces catch, add progressively larger fuel to the fire.</p>
