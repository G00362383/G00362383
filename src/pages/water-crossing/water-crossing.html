      <b>Water Crossing</b>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>There are <b>three</b> main factors to figuring if you should ford: speed, depth, and obstacles.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p><b>Speed</b> is the simplest one to gauge. Throw a stick in the water and try to walk alongside it. If it races away,
            the river is too fast.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p><b>Depth</b> is a little trickier. Generally speaking, avoid crossing moderately swift water that’s deeper than
            mid-thigh. Err on the side of caution when you estimate depth. You might have to turn back after testing the
            proverbial waters.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>Finally, <b>obstacles:</b> Avoid crossing upstream of downed trees, which can hold you underwater if you fall and get
            hung up in one, or waterfalls.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>If your spot doesn’t meet all of these criteria, look elsewhere for wider areas where the water is generally
            slower and shallower. If there’s been a recent storm, wait 24 hours.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>Ready to cross? Unclip all pack straps. Don water shoes if you’ve got them, but if you don’t, leave your boots
            on. This is no place to slip.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>Solo hikers should use a stick or trekking pole, face upstream, and cut a diagonal path against the current.
            More people means more stability. Groups of two should put hands on each other’s shoulders and cross sideways
            with the stronger hiker’s back to the current.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>Groups of three can all put hands on each other’s shoulders and cross in a triangle formation. Larger groups
            can form a conga line with the strongest hiker in front and the next strongest in the back.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>If you do end up in the drink, shed your pack, point your feet downstream, and paddle like hell for shore.</p>
